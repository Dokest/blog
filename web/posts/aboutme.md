# About me
Hello! My name is **Jorge Moreno** and I am from Spain. I studied **Computer Science** in *Rey Juan Carlos University* in Madrid, where I am also studying a **Master's Degree in Computer Vision**.

## Education & work experience
My programming education started after finishing high school, when I studied Web Development. After finishing this two-year degree I worked for half a year for *Ezzing*, a company that created a CMS to handle solar panel installations. I stopped working for *Ezzing* as soon as I got into university, where I studied a degree in **Computer Science* (2019-2023). While finishing my degree I also worked as a back-end programmer for *Powen*, a company that sells and installs solar panels as well.

I am currently studying a **Master's Degree in Computer Vision**, that includes Deep Learning (*PyTorch*/*Tensorflow*), Machine Learning (*scikit-learn*) and traditional image processing techniques (*OpenCV*).

## Non-official education
I have always had an interest in videogames, and as so, I taught myself Unreal Engine 4/5 including C++ and Blueprints.

## Technologies & tools
### Common
Both in my professional and hobby projects, I use Git and Conventional Commit to keep track of my work ([see the repository for this blog](https://github.com/Dokest/blog)).

I also like to document my projects in *Markdown*, *Google Docs*, *Microsoft Word* and/or *LaTeX*.

### Web Development
While working as a back-end programmer I have used *Laravel* (PHP) and *NestJs* (Typescript/Javascript).

I created **Nobuk** as a simpler but powerful alternative to *Nestjs*. **Nobuk** is written from scratch on top of Deno with memory, performance and simplicity in mind.

> Nobuk is not currently public, as there is still work to be done before Open-Sourcing it. But as a prototype, this page is already running on top on Nobuk.

### Game Development
I learned many tools to create my small game prototypes, the non-exhaustive list includes:
- Unreal Engine 4/5 including:
	o Gameplay Ability System plugin
	o Networking (C++/Blueprints)
	o Widgets
	o Animation blueprints
- Godot 2D & Godot 3D
- Blender
