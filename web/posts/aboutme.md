# About me
Hello! My name is **Jorge Moreno** and I am from Spain. I studied **Computer Science** in *Rey Juan Carlos University* in Madrid, where I am also studying a **Master's Degree in Computer Vision**.

## Education & work experience
My programming education started after finishing high school, when I studied Web Development. After finishing this two-year degree I worked for half a year for *Ezzing*, a company that created a CMS to handle solar panel installations. I stopped working for *Ezzing* as soon as I got into university, where I studied a degree in **Computer Science* (2019-2023). While finishing my degree I also worked as a back-end programmer for *Powen*, a company that sells and installs solar panels as well.

I am currently studying a **Master's Degree in Computer Vision**, that includes Deep Learning, Machine Learning and traditional image processing techniques.

## Non-official education
I have always had an interest in videogames, and as so, I taught myself Unreal Engine 4/5 including C++ and Blueprints.
