Hello! My name is **Jorge Moreno** and I am from Spain. I studied **Computer Science** in *"Universidad Rey Juan Carlos"* in Madrid, where I am also studying a **Master's Degree in Computer Vision**.

My programming education started after finishing high school, where I studied Web Development, after finishing this two-year degree I worked for half a year for *Ezzing*, a company that created a CMS to handle solar panels installations. I stopped working for *Ezzing* as soon as I got into university where I studied a degree in **Computer Science* (2019-2023), while finishing my degree I also worked as a back-end programmer for *Powen*, a company that sells and installs solar panels.

I am currently studying a **Master's Degree in Computer Vision**, that includes Deep Learning, Machine Learning and traditional image processing techniques.

## Non-official education
I have always have a interest in videogames, as such, I learned Unreal Engine 4/5 (C++ and Blueprints) from many YouTube tutorials, I also learned C++ from CppCon talks.
